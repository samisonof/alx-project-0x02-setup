# Next.js Project Setup and Basics

## Introduction

Welcome to the `alx-project-0x02-setup` repository!

This repository serves as the foundational setup for a Next.js project, focusing on project structure, configuration, and essential development tools. It is part of the ALX Full-Stack Web Development curriculum and is intended to help learners understand how to scaffold and initialize a professional-grade Next.js application using TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.

In this project, we will:

- Initialize a Next.js app with TypeScript.
- Set up Tailwind CSS for styling.
- Configure reusable components and folder structure.
- Prepare the app for future feature development.

Stay tuned for further updates and enhancements.
